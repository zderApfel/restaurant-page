        "mainWhatIsBorger": "Zach gets this question a lot, it's asked a lot by many customers, in fact. The fact of the matter is that it's not important what a borger is. They taste good, so why ask? Nobody has ever gotten sick from a borger, and nobody is allergic to them either. It's impossible to say any of those things has happened. So please, just calm down and eat your borger."
